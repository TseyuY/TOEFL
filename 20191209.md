### Writing

​		Some people claim that life in the past days is harder than it was today due to the various reasons. However, I possess a different opinion that life cannot be simply discussed from a sole aspect. By that I mean, we will obtain different conclusions from a separate aspect. 

​		Needless to say that materials have been increasingly developed due to the advanced technologies and techniques compared with the life when our grandparents were children. However, not only the materials affect the life, but also the mental life have an influence on our life. Though our grandparents may lack different materials such as food, clothes, they had less pressure than we are facing owling to the dramatic competition in society. For instance, the employment rate is relatively low because of the automatic machine, and the factory does not need many workers. With the complement of techniques, the company requires less engineer. Therefore, owling to the low employment rate life today is harder.

​		It goes without saying that we are better off and we can achieve the materials that our grandparents couldn't attain. Yet the fact is that our grandparents do not need the thing that we can easily obtain today. For instance, they did not need the Internet because the books in the library were sufficient for them at their time. For another instance, had I was born at the time, I would ride a bike to school instead of buses and subways. Riding benefits our health. By that I mean, the materials easily achieved today can be replaced by the things available at their time.

​		Clearly, it is difficult to say whether the life today is better or the life past was better. It totally depends on the respective you are viewing. In other words, it is too simplistic to conclude on one point of view.
