## Writing

​		Some people claim that university is just a place to study. There is no practical use in spending money on sports and social activities. I disagree with this opinion.

​		Granted, the university is a place for individuals to study. However, we should **put a premium on** taking physical exercise and social activities. We are supposed to **bear in mind that** health comes the first. For one thing, physical exercises **promote the development of** our health. Therefore, we can **boost efficiency** during studying instead of studying with low productivity. Also, our health will recover faster **due to** the physical exercises. In contrast, the student who lacks physical exercises would recover slowly. Had they exercise more, they wouldn't have got ill. The illness will delay the process of study. With the financial support for sports, the students will get more opportunities to do sports.

​		Few can deny that the students **dedicate a wealth of time to social activities**. Yet the importance of doing social activities is often ignored. For instance, the social activities usually give the students inspiration of innovation. It **expands their horizons**. If the students just do experiments and read textbook, they will **merely** learn the knowledge has existed. Thus, we are supposed to **put a high value on** social activities. Furthermore, social activities can help students to relax. The students would be tired of studying, if they have learned for a long time. Doing social activities gives students relaxation. **Owing to** the reasons proposed above, **definitely**, it is **crucial** to do the equal support on social activities.

​		Needless to say, it is not unreasonable for universities and colleges to put the same financial support on sports and social activities as classes and libraries. It is worthwhile to make the same efforts.

​		Some people claim that under no circumstances should the individual tell a lie in any relationships. Yet I possess a different opinion. Telling a lie doesn't always mean hurt, sometimes it tends to protect. It depends on the relationships.

​		Granted, it is crucial to tell the truth. Without truth, the individuals live in the fake world. Not only does the lie hurt physically, it also hurt individuals mentally. However, sometimes the truth also results to bad effects. For instance, my friend's grandfather passed away when he was taking the college entrance examination. His parents told him the truth, and he was frustrated. He cannot concentrate on exam any more. And he has to take exam again. Had his parents not told the truth, he wouldn't have to dedicate a wealth of time to prepare another year. Thus, telling the truth depends on relationships.

​		No one can deny that sometimes the lies warm people's heart. However, it won't boost the efficiency while working. As you have detected an error made by your college, while you tend to conceal for the sake of his self-esteem. This won't **benefit** the company. More efforts and time spent on detecting the error made the lower productivity. Definitely, it is not wise to tell a lie during work.

​		Needless to say, whether telling the truth or lie depends on the relationships between people, and also depends on the events. We are supposed to consider the circumstance intellectively. In other words, we should take the events and the relationships between people into consideration.

 It is too simplistic to say that

​		Some people usually claim that their old friends become strangers, while others claim that they are supposed to make new friends due to the short of friends. In my point of view, it is too simplistic to say that which should be put a value on owling to the complex of the friendship.
​		Few can deny that with the lack of communications we are not familiar with our old friends like before. It is not uncommon, because we are confronted with the heavy work and study. Hardly can we dedicate a wealth of time to our social activities with our friends. Consequently, the friendship diminishes. We are supposed to keep our old friends. Instead of participating in various party with friends, we are able to connect with our friends  through internet or phone calls. It is unwise to be limited by the form. 
​		It goes without saying that making new friends should also be put on a premium. Old friends sometimes move to another city or both of you need to calm down for a while due to the diverge of an opinion. It is new friends who help you wind down. For instance, one of my new friends accompanied helped me pass the day when my old friend left.
​		Needless to say that not only the old friends count, but also the new friends is necessary. Because all of the old friends and the new friends contribute to friendship. Friendship can never be evaluated by old and new.
