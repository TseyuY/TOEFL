### Writing

​		Some people claim that the TV commercials directed to young children are supposed to be forbidden. I believe that it is reasonable for several reasons.

​		Needless to say that the young children have a poor understanding. However, the TV commercial is still pushed toward young children. This is skeptical because the young children are unable to judge the advertisement. Therefore, why the merchant pushes the advertisement directly to the children? Apparently, they are looking forward to the children asking their parents to buy the products. I assume that many parents will not decline the proposal from their crying children. Thus they will buy the product. However, this behavior will cultivate a bad habit. Every time the children ask for toys or snacks, they will cry to their parents and ask for it. They will lose the belief to earn it. Consequently, this will lead to a bad habit in the long run.

​		Moreover, maybe some people claim that the children will learn something through the TV commercial. However, the products, which the children think through advertisement, are quite different from the what it was announced on the advertisement. For instance, my little niece asked me to buy a doll. However, when I received the doll, I was shocked by the quality and the appearance. That was totally two things. Had I had another opportunity, I would buy my niece some delicious food instead of the poor-quality doll. The product is likely to be a rubbish which pushes TV commercial toward very young children.

​		Clearly, TV commercial, which directed toward young children, should not be allowed. Not only will we buy the thing the children do not require, but also cultivate a bad habit. By what I mean, the TV commercial directed toward children is totally a trick.
